## Document Purpose

This document serves as a **complete system analysis and design deliverable** for the **Ruqi Store** ecosystem. It demonstrates the end-to-end process of analyzing e-commerce business workflows, gathering functional and non-functional requirements, modeling database and system behaviors, and designing a robust, modern technical solution.

The report covers every phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) from initial planning and stakeholder analysis, through object-oriented design, to detailed architectural blueprints.

## Document Conventions

In order to maintain strict engineering standards across all documentation files, the following identifiers and tools are utilized:

* **`FR-XXX`** — Functional Requirement identifier (e.g., `FR-01`).
* **`NFR-XXX`** — Non-Functional Requirement identifier (e.g., `NFR-U1`).
* **`UC-XXX`** — Use Case identifier (e.g., `UC-03`).
* **`US-XXX`** — User Story identifier (e.g., `US-02`).
* **Diagram Notation:** All structural and behavioral diagrams (ERD, Sequence Flows) are written using **Mermaid.js** notation for seamless rendering directly within GitHub Markdown.
* **Priority Levels:** Managed strictly via the **MoSCoW** prioritization matrix (*Must-Have / Should-Have / Could-Have / Won't-Have*).
* **Technology Implementation:** Designed for a robust implementation using **ASP.NET Core MVC** with Entity Framework Core, supporting SQLite during development and SQL Server in production.
